    "content": "I just want to take a moment to say thank you to everyone who showed up for the release of the first chapter last night.\n\nThe reception has been absolutely incredible across this site, Discord, and WebNovel. In just our first release, we’ve already passed 1,200+ views across all three platforms, something I honestly never expected for Chapter One.\n\nI’m genuinely proud of what I’m building here, and even more grateful to have such an amazing community supporting this journey from the very beginning.\n\nThis is only the start and I can’t wait to show you what comes next.\n\nThank you for believing in this story.\nThank you for being here.\nAnd thank you for reading. 🙏\n\n- BigDomo",
